/*
All values are stored in memory. Every location in memory has an address. A pointer is a memory address.
When to use them?

Pointers allow you to share a value stored in some memory location. Use pointers when
1. you donâ€™t want to pass around a lot of data (enterprise load)
2. you want to change the data at a location (http client?)
